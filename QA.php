              				<td>No. Unfortunately, we will not make exceptions. We have many reasons to include this article in the Moorage Agreement. Our staff walks the docks regularly. We try to prevent or limit damage to boats and marina structures.<br><br>
								For example, if we notice a boat low in the water, we will investigate. The Ship Canal water surface also changes elevations. The elevation change causes fenders to be at wrong locations for boats and dock protection. The boat securing lines also may become excessively loose or tight.<br><br>
								Our staff may remedy these and other issues by taking action. Our actions benefit our tenants and protect the marina structures.</td>
