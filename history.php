          <h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
          <p>Charles Draper II (Sr.) and his father Frank Draper purchased the marina property located in Seattle on the Lake Washington Ship Canal in 1945. 
          	They were the first to develop the lands on which the marina stands today. Charles Draper Sr. designed and completed construction of Salmon Bay 
          	Marina in 1961. (Original Advertisement)<br><br>Charles Draper Sr. designed large boat turning radii between the covered piers and constructed 
          	the slips for wide beam boats. His design also included heat vents and aluminum roofs for fire protection and condensation reduction. His foresight 
          	of slip design still provides slip sizes for today’s pleasure craft industry.</p>
