          <h3><strong>RULES & REGULATIONS</strong></h3>
          <p>Salmon Bay Marina (The Marina) is located in the City of Seattle 
              adjacent to the U.S. Government Lake Washington Ship Canal. The 
              Marina premises includes: covered and open moorage, building structures, 
              parking lots, piers, waters on Marina real estate and waters under 
              The Marina's control. All covered slips have metered electrical 
              power. Fresh water is available on all piers subject to cold weather 
              shut-off. The Marina is not a boat yard. Boat yard work must be 
              performed at a boat yard. Breach of The Marina's Rules and Regulations 
              may lead to Moorage Termination subject to the Moorage Agreement.</p>
            <p>Tenants are expected to be good neighbors. A good relationship 
              between management and tenants is of the highest priority. We appreciate 
              your help and cooperation. Should there be any misunderstanding 
              please come to the marina office for help.<br>
              THANK YOU</p>
            <p><b>BERTHING:</b> Boats must be moored to ensure walkways are clear 
              and such things as anchors, dinghy's, and bowsprits do not obstruct 
              walk ways. Vessels not registered with The Marina Office and/or 
              not following registration and insurance requirements shall not 
              moor at the marina without first obtaining permission from the management. 
            </p>
            <p><b>BOARDING:</b> Boats moored at The Marina are private property 
              and no one, except per the moorage agreement, will be allowed to 
              board any boat without the owners' permission. Tenants must notify 
              The Marina office of authorized visitors or workmen who may be boarding 
              a tenant's boat without the owners' presence. Failure to notify 
              the marina will result in restricting visitors or workmen from the 
              docks.</p>
